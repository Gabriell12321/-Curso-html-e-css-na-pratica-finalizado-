  <h1><font color = "#FFFFFF"> What is Lorem Ipsum? </font></h1>
  <p> <font size="20px" face="verdana">Ipsum is simply </font> text of the printing and <strong> typesetting industry. </strong> </strong> <br> Ipsum has been 
    the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown <hr> took a galley of type 
    and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the 
    leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br> was popularised in the 1960s 
    with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
     publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
    <hr>
  <h2>  Why do we use it? </h2>
  <p>  It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
     when looking at its layout. <br> The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a <br> more-or-less normal
      distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
       readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum
        as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover <br> many web sites still
         in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes
          on purpose (injected humour and the like). </p>
